# Applied Programming

## Task:

Write a program for drawing lots by generating random numbers.

There are N barrels in a bag of barrels (from 1 to N).

Pressing the button - pulling out the next keg from the bag.

We remove the elongated kegs to the side (i.e. each number can fall out only 1 time).

## Program name:

Random drawer 

## Description:

The program draws lots by shuffling the sequence

## How to use:

To use the program, you need to follow these steps:
1) Compile the executable file of the program from the source code or use the precompiled version
2) Run the program
3) Enter number
4) Get the execution result

## Comments from the developer:

To develop this program, a development environment called Clion was used.
Compilation was performed using the CMake tool. You can use any development environment to open the main.cpp source code file. For your convenience, in the cmake-build-debug folder you can find a precompiled version of the program.
